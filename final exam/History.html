        <h4>Ancient times</h4>
        <p>In ancient times, the land that is now Kazakhstan was home to various nomadic tribes, among them the Saka and the Huns. The Saka, led by rulers like Skunkha and Bartatua, were prominent in the region from around the 7th to the 3rd century BCE. Their kurgans, or burial mounds, reveal intricate gold artifacts, providing insights into their advanced craftsmanship and cultural practices.

          As we move forward in time, the Huns, led by Attila the Hun, rose to prominence in the 5th century CE. Although the Huns were not exclusive to Kazakhstan, they played a significant role in shaping the nomadic cultures of the Central Asian steppes.
          
          Geographically, Kazakhstan's historical significance is underscored by its position between Europe and Asia. The vast territory, led by nomadic leaders such as Skunkha and Attila, facilitated cultural exchanges and trade routes, contributing to the rich tapestry of Central Asian history.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="item-2">
        <h4>Middle Ages </h4>
        <p>
          During the Middle Ages, Kazakhstan experienced a dynamic blend of cultures and civilizations. In the 8th to 14th centuries, the Turkic Khaganate emerged as a powerful political entity. Notable leaders like Bilge Khagan and Kultegin played instrumental roles in shaping the Turkic identity. Their efforts laid the foundation for a Turkic cultural legacy that endured through the centuries.
          
          In the 13th century, the Mongol invasion under Genghis Khan reshaped the entire Central Asian landscape, including Kazakhstan. The Golden Horde, a Mongol khanate, exerted influence over the region for several centuries. Leaders like Berke Khan and Tokhtamysh played key roles in the politics and trade networks of the time.
          
          Geographically, the Silk Road traversed through Kazakhstan, connecting East and West. Cities like Taraz and Otrar became vibrant centers of commerce and cultural exchange.
          
          The Middle Ages in Kazakhstan were characterized by a synthesis of Turkic, Mongol, and Persian influences. The nomadic lifestyle persisted, and the Great Steppe became a melting pot of traditions. This era set the stage for the subsequent development of the Kazakh Khanate and its unique identity.</p>

      <div id="item-3">
        <h4>Kazakh government</h4>
        <p>The 15th to 18th centuries marked a significant chapter in Kazakhstan's history with the rise of the Kazakh Khanate. Emerging from the disintegration of the Golden Horde, the Kazakh Khanate became a prominent political entity on the Great Steppe. The legendary figure, Khan Kasym, played a pivotal role in the formation of the khanate, unifying the Kazakh tribes.

          Under the leadership of Kasym Khan, the Kazakh Khanate expanded its influence across the vast steppe territories. The capital, Atyrau, became a center for governance and trade. The khanate's political structure and legal codifications, known as "Zhety Zhargy," contributed to the cohesion of the Kazakh people.
          
          During this period, the Kazakh Khanate faced external pressures, particularly from the expanding Russian Empire and the Dzungar Khanate. The Battle of Zharkent in 1716, led by Khan Abulkhair, marked a crucial moment in the defense of Kazakh lands against the Dzungars.
          
          Geographically, the Kazakh Khanate covered a vast expanse, encompassing parts of modern-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia. The Silk Road continued to play a crucial role in connecting cultures and facilitating trade.
          
          The 15th to 18th centuries laid the groundwork for the subsequent historical developments in Kazakhstan, shaping its identity and resilience against external forces.</p>

        <h4>20 century</h4>
        <p>The 20th century brought unprecedented changes to Kazakhstan, reshaping its socio-political landscape. The region witnessed the tumultuous effects of two world wars, the Russian Revolution, and the eventual establishment of the Soviet Union. Here's a glimpse into Kazakhstan's 20th-century history:

          The early 1900s saw Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire, undergoing social and economic transformations. The October Revolution of 1917 ushered in the Soviet era, and by 1936, Kazakhstan became a Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR.
          
          The 1920s and 1930s saw the implementation of collectivization and forced agricultural reforms, leading to significant upheavals and the tragic famine of the early 1930s. The nomadic way of life, integral to Kazakh culture, faced suppression as the Soviet government sought to modernize and industrialize the region.
          
          World War II brought immense challenges, with many Kazakhs participating in the war effort. The war also led to the relocation of industries to Kazakhstan as a safe haven during the conflict.
          
          The post-war period witnessed the development of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, a key site for the Soviet space program. It played a crucial role in space exploration, including the launch of the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961.
          
          The late 20th century marked the era of political and economic reforms. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, leading to the declaration of Kazakhstan's independence. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had been in power since 1989, became the country's first President.
          
          Kazakhstan faced the challenges of nation-building, economic transition, and establishing a new identity on the global stage. The country renounced nuclear weapons, and Astana (now Nur-Sultan) became the new capital in 1997.
          
          The 20th century encapsulates a period of profound transformation for Kazakhstan, from its early days under Soviet rule to the emergence of an independent nation navigating the complexities of the modern world.</p>

        <h4>Independence</h4>
        <p>The period from 1991 to 2021 marked a crucial chapter in the history of independent Kazakhstan. Here's an overview of the significant events and developments during these three decades:

          1991-1999: Early Independence and Nation-Building
          Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan declared its independence on December 16. Nursultan Nazarbayev became the country's first President. The early years were marked by efforts to establish state institutions, formulate economic policies, and define a national identity.
          
          Kazakhstan faced challenges related to the transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy. The government implemented economic reforms, including privatization and liberalization, to spur growth and attract foreign investment.
          
          2000-2010: Economic Growth and Capital Relocation
          The early 2000s saw Kazakhstan experiencing economic growth, driven primarily by its vast natural resources, particularly oil and gas. The country became a significant player in the global energy market. In 1997, the capital was moved from Almaty to Astana, which was later renamed Nur-Sultan in honor of Nursultan Nazarbayev.
          
          Kazakhstan continued to pursue political and economic reforms, aiming to diversify its economy and reduce dependence on natural resources. The country actively participated in international diplomacy and sought to position itself as a key player in Central Asia.
          
          2011-2021: Modernization and Transition
          Nursultan Nazarbayev's resignation in 2019 marked a historic moment, and Kassym-Jomart Tokayev assumed the presidency. The government intensified efforts to modernize the economy, enhance social welfare, and strengthen democratic institutions.
          
          Kazakhstan actively engaged in global initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, fostering economic partnerships and infrastructure development. The country continued to play a pivotal role in regional stability and cooperation.
          
          The 30th anniversary of independence in 2021 provided an opportunity for reflection on Kazakhstan's achievements and challenges. The nation stands at the crossroads of further economic diversification, technological advancement, and continued efforts to build a resilient and prosperous society.
          
          As Kazakhstan entered its fourth decade of independence, it faced the task of navigating a rapidly changing global landscape while preserving its cultural heritage and advancing the well-being of its citizens.</p>
